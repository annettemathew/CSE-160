ChatGPT for some help with the sphere/egg implementation. I knew I wanted to use damping oscillation to create a jumping /bounce effect rather than the sin/cos that was taught in the tutorial. I initially wanted to create a feeding mechanism to feed the chicken and then cause it to lay eggs, but unfortunately due to time constraint as well as processing constraints I was unable to finish rendering and coding the logic for the seeds. I ended up using e^x * sin x/ cos x for the logic to animate the damping oscillation and also created a slight walking + eye narrowing animation for when shift-click was pressed.
